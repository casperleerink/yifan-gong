## Short Biography

<div class="lines-1"></div>

<!--StartFragment-->

I am Yifan Gong, a current PhD candidate in Theatre and Performance Studies at Edinburgh College of Art, the University of Edinburgh. My PhD is on the theme of **strategising the Theatre of One Emancipated Spect-actor using accumulating methods**. Theatre of One is an  applied theatre approach led by the **accumulative aesthetics and the aesthetics of the emancipated spect-actor** referencing **Augusto Boal and Jacques Ranciere’s political aesthetics and practical methodologies**. As a practitioner in the flesh, I conduct **performative (practice-led), phenomenological and hermeneutic research methods to produce intermedial performances and to research** this theme. 

I hold a BFA degree with distinction in Theatre and Visual Arts from the University of the Fraser Valley, Canada. I started to take theatre and visual arts courses (painting and analogue photography) in January 2017 and learned filmmaking at Shanghai Vancouver Film School in 2020/21. 

My artistic practices so far span devised theatre, digital performance, filmmaking, directing and acting for theatre/screen, analogue and digital photography, acrylic painting, songwriting, post-modern dance and choreography. My research areas include but are not limited to: **phenomenology, hermeneutics, theatre and performance aesthetics, philosophy of art, intermediality and intermedial art, XR media and technologies, volumetric capture and volumetric film, practice-led/based research, digital humanism**, immersive theatre, devised theatre and psychology of personality traits. 

Digging deeper into trans/interdisciplinary art research with the rapid development of science and technology is a necessity for this generation, so I am passionate about integrating new technologies within contemporary art-making. In terms of genres, I often manipulate non-linear storytelling, abstract expressionism and improvisation. 

As well as an E-portfolio, this personal website consists of collections of my significant artworks made so far, including digital documents, showreels and video recordings of live/mediatised performances.

## Artist Statement

<!--StartFragment-->

I have been studying overseas and living alone for 9 years. Besides both the East and West have shaped me culturally, my long-term single life leads my art research and practices to focus on my solitude, soliloquy, self-doubt, self-exploration, and self-growth. There are perpetual internal communications within and between my art such as performance, film, painting, photography and music, where I constantly self-question and self-answer. The reflexive circle of questioning-answering makes my acting and creating retrospective and spirally develops my art skills. This way, my aloneness conveys its beauty and expresses my inner power.

For instance, wisely adopting varied digital media, I create streams of layered physical or theatrical performances of my single self, where I continuously retrospect and reflect on myself. These productions are both live performances and mediatised videos, where I traverse the boundaries between reality and virtuality, past and present, the digital and the physical. Similar to my photomontage practices where I superimpose my doppelgangers across time and space, via constant self-reflection and self-interaction, these projects accumulate performative contents overlooking spatial-temporal barriers and embody my aloneness artistically, physically and digitally. This practice-based research provides examples of creating performances of a single one to promote self-awareness and self-growth and is an applied theatre approach benefiting contemporary performance methodology.

Informed by art movements since the mid-19th century such as Impressionism, Dadaism, Fluxus and Happening, for my pursuit of self-revealing and returning to true nature, with physical actions, I squeeze acrylic paints from the tubes directly and apply them onto the canvas baldly. I often mix colours afterwards. This phenomenological reductive attitude and technique has been extended and applied in my embodied drawing/painting. I take out solid or liquid pigments directly and throw/splash them onto the paper/canvas with my whole performing body. My directing style for films and live performances also reflects this intuitive wildness. I improvisationally dance and act with my actors in sync, response or contrast when directing. I first learned filmmaking by audaciously taking on multiple roles and intuitively using my theatre-making knowledge. The choreography and body movements of my filmed/live performances similarly feature chances and improvisation, in line with my intrinsic understanding of physicality and dance, echoing the concepts of Merce Cunningham, Jerzy Grotowski, Mary Overlie, and Trisha Brown.

Besides expressing individuality, I keep asking myself - if nobody loves me, how can I love myself? I argue that the last step to emancipation is self-love, recognising that one was born and will die alone. This is realistic and individualistic but not bourgeois or capitalist as taking care of oneself is the priority. My artistic productions aim to awaken self-awareness and the desire to self-explore and self-care from various perspectives. My art research aims to address that an individual can save themselves before rescuing the group or being rescued by the group. Yet nothing is absolute as we are not absolute minds — my art is not absolute but ambiguous, complex and exploratory likewise.
