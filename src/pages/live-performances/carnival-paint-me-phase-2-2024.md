It’s all about I, me, myself.
It’s me, in an infinite hermeneutic circle, drawing me, speaking to me, answering me, caring about me and trying to love me. I’m wavering though. 

This is a live performance of the CARNIVAL: Paint ME series in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. 

Directed, produced, performed and edited by Yifan Gong 
Documented by Yisheng Ding and Bopeng Hao 
Music by Zhuohan Zhao and Yifan Gong
