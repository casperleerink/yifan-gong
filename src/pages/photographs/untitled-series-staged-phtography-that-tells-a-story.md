## Artist Statement

<div class="lines-1"></div>

<!--StartFragment-->

I feel like I have multiple personalities.  In my imagination, many of my self/s play different roles with different personalities in various dimensions, where I am either calm or crazy, concentrated or disordered, brave or scared, cold or warm. I constantly question whether I have killed someone in another dimension or if someone else has killed me. But who? In this world where I feel genuinely alive, I strongly believe in Hemingway’s most famous quote, “A man can be destroyed but not defeated.” I argue the only one who can finally defeat me is just myself. I always seem to “try to kill my past self/s” in different situations in various dimensions; in fact, I keep oscillating, spiralling and reincarnating in diverse times and spaces. This is the adventurous circling process of being and living. It is so exciting and so live.
