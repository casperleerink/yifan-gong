## Overview

Have you ever dreamed that you unconsciously slipped and fell from the stairs? Have you ever dreamed that you forgot to take your umbrella when it was raining cats and dogs, then drowned in the deep water? Or I wonder whether you are a tough person, you hardly cry in front of other people, but sometimes you suddenly wake up from a nightmare, with your face covered by tears and pyjamas soaked in sweat? Whether your answer is “Yes” or “No”, please follow me and let’s start a new dream journey in 坠(Fall).

## *坠Fall* (Full video)

This is Yifan Gong’s first experimental short film. It introduces a series of dreams of mine where I traverse various times, spaces and dimensions. This laid the conceptual and practical foundations for my subsequent practice-led PhD research. My daydreams and nightmares are very complicated consisting of multiple narratives and fantastic stories in which I play different characters. This may be because my cerebral cortex is overactive. It is such a burden for me, but it brings abundant beauty and fantasies to my art. 

Keywords: non-linear narrative, experimental short, dance video, music video, Acting-Without-Words
